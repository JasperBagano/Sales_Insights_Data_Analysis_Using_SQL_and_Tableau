# Sales_Insights_Data_Analysis_Using_SQL_and_Tableau

I am sharing a personal project performing data analysis of an eletronics company's sales data using SQL and Tableau.

### Objective:
The goal is to analyze the customer behavior and sales performance of electronic products to derive actionable insights on customer demographics, product preferences, payment methods, and order status. The tools I used were **MySQL** for data storage and **Tableau** for analysis and visualization.

### Problem Statement:
The electronics company is facing challenges in understanding customer behavior, product performance, and order fulfillment processes. Despite having extensive sales data, the company struggles to derive actionable insights that could help improve decision-making and optimize business operations.
1. Time-Based Sales Trends:
   - What are the key trends in monthly sales, and how do seasonal variations impact revenue?
   - Are there any patterns that can be leveraged to optimize marketing and inventory strategies?
2. Product Performance:
    - Which product types and SKUs are driving the most revenue, and what factors (such as customer ratings) are influencing sales performance?
    - Which product types and SKUs are cancelled most of the time which result to lost sales?
3. Customer Demographics:
    - How does customer age, gender, and loyalty status influence purchasing decisions?
    - What is the profile of high-value customers, and how can loyalty programs be optimized to increase retention?
4. Order Fulfillment and Payment Methods:
    - What is the rate of order cancellations, and how do factors like payment methods and shipping options affect order completion?
    - Which payment methods are most popular, and how do they impact the overall sales process?
